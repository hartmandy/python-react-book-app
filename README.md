Hello! This project was created while learning Python. I created a Python Flask API and a React frontend to create simple CRUD operations for a bookshelf app. If you found your way to this page, feel free to try it out yourself!

The backend can run with command 'python3 main.py' and the frontend with 'npm run dev' - have fun!
